## Python Turtle Script for Birthday Display
---

### **Step 1: Install Python**
If you don't already have Python installed, download and install it from the official website:
- [Python Official Website](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

During installation, make sure to check the box that says **"Add Python to PATH"** (this makes it easier to run Python from the command line).

---

### **Step 2: Verify Python Installation**
Open a terminal or command prompt and type:
```bash
python --version
```
or
```bash
python3 --version
```
This should display the installed Python version (e.g., `Python 3.11.5`). If you see this, Python is installed correctly.

---

### **Step 3: Save Your Python Script**
1. Open a text editor (e.g., Notepad, VS Code, Sublime Text, or any code editor).
2. Copy and paste the Python script (e.g., the `turtle` script for drawing "24") into the editor.
3. Save the file with a `.py` extension, for example: `birthday_turtle.py`.

---

### **Step 4: Run the Script**
There are two main ways to run a Python script:

#### **Option 1: Using the Command Line/Terminal**
1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the folder where your script is saved. For example:
   ```bash
   cd path/to/your/project
   ```
3. Run the script using Python:
   ```bash
   python birthday_turtle.py
   ```
   or (if `python` doesn't work):
   ```bash
   python3 birthday_turtle.py
   ```

#### **Option 2: Using an IDE (Integrated Development Environment)**
If you're using an IDE like **VS Code**, **PyCharm**, or **Thonny**:
1. Open the IDE and load your project folder.
2. Open the Python script (`birthday_turtle.py`).
3. Click the **Run** button (usually a green play icon) or use the keyboard shortcut (e.g., `F5` in VS Code).

---

### **Step 5: View the Output**
- If you're running the `turtle` script, a new window will open displaying the graphics (e.g., the numbers "24").
- For other projects, the output will be displayed in the terminal or IDE console.

---

### **Troubleshooting Common Issues**
1. **Python Not Found**:
   - If you get an error like `python: command not found`, ensure Python is installed and added to your system's PATH.
   - Try using `python3` instead of `python`.

2. **Module Not Found**:
   - If you get an error like `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'turtle'`, it means the `turtle` module is missing (though it should come pre-installed with Python).
   - Reinstall Python or check your installation.

3. **Script Doesn't Run**:
   - Ensure the file has a `.py` extension.
   - Make sure you're in the correct directory when running the script from the terminal.

---

### **Example: Running the Turtle Script**
Hereâ€™s how you would run the `turtle` script step-by-step:

1. Save the script as `birthday_turtle.py`.
2. Open a terminal.
3. Navigate to the folder where the script is saved:
   ```bash
   cd path/to/your/project
   ```
4. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python birthday_turtle.py
   ```
5. A window will open, and the turtle will draw the numbers "24".
